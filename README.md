<h1 align="center">About Me</h1>
<h3 align="center">SWE Intern @ Jacobs | C.S. + Stats @ BU '25</h3>

I'm a software engineer specializing in .NET, MERN, and Python scripting. My past projects include desktop apps, mobile apps, and full-stack websites. I'm currently working year-round as a SWE intern at Jacobs. I study computer science and statistics at Boston University, and I am open to full-time job offers after I graduate in May 2025.

I spend most of my free time on personal projects, and I regularly update my LinkedIn and GitHub profiles to reflect my latest work. Some highlights include a real estate price predictor, a Chrome extension that reports bias in news sites, and a Twitter sentiment analyzer. I enjoy learning new technologies and have won two hackathons (“BostonHacks 2022” and “BU Spark! Mini-Hackathon 2022”; see projects). Along with honing my developer skills, my projects help me research tech trends. For example, I’ve recently bought an Oculus Quest 2 headset. I look forward to exploring existing products and using my game engine experience to develop new VR experiences.

I’m an officer in BU’s computer science honor society (UPE). My responsibilities include promoting club engagement, documenting our processes, and brainstorming new events. As the owner of the organization’s website, I’m also in charge of coordinating student developers as we upgrade the obsolete WordPress site into a MERN web app.

My favorite books about coding are “Clean Code” by Robert C. Martin, “Refactoring” by Martin Fowler, and “The Cuckoo’s Egg” by Clifford Stoll. Feel free to message me recommendations!
