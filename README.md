## About me
I'm a C.S. student at Boston University ('26). I am passionate about full-stack web development. Along with GitHub, I use [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sai-nayunipati-157609224/) and maintain a [portfolio](https://sai-nayunipati.github.io/portfolio/index.html). I can be reached at [sai.nayunipati@gmail.com](mailto:sai.nayunipati@gmail.com).

I have built projects using:
- Bootstrap
- Python
- Flask
- MySQL
- MongoDB
- And several other technologies.

## Selected Works
Here are some of the projects I'm proudest of:

- **[E-Commerce site](https://github.com/sai-nayunipati/Hallmark-Induction-Projects/tree/main/Projects/13.%20Mock%20E-Commerce%20Site):** A mock e-commerce site that pulls example products from a MySQL database. The site supports adding items to a cart. (*Bootstrap, Flask, MySQL*)

- **[Talluri Technologies](https://github.com/sai-nayunipati/Hallmark-Induction-Projects/tree/main/Projects/17.%20Remade%20Talluri%20Technologies%20Website):** I redesigned a static [website](http://talluritechnologies.com/) belonging to a company I interned for. This was an exercise in front-end development and designing a good user interface. (*Bootstrap, jQuery*)

- **[Chess Player API](https://github.com/sai-nayunipati/Hallmark-Induction-Projects/tree/main/Projects/15.%20API%20With%20Flask%20and%20MongoDB):** I used the "Scrapy" Python library to scrape [chess.com](https://www.chess.com/players) for a list of the world's best chess players and their relevant statistics. I stored the data in MongoDB, and created a Flask API which can both read and write to the database. (*Scrapy, Flask, MongoDB*)
