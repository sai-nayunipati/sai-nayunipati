## About me
I am a first-year C.S. student Boston University ('26). My passions are full-stack web and software development. I am especially intereted in the fields of artificial intelligence and hope to explore it in the future. Soon I hope to start writing [blog posts](https://sai-nayunipati.github.io/portfolio/blog.html).

I have built projects using:
- Bootstrap
- Python
- Flask
- MySQL
- MongoDB
- And several other technologies.

## Selected Works
Here are some of the projects I'm proudest of:

- **E-Commerce site:** A mock e-commerce site that pulls example products from a MySQL database. The site supports adding items to a cart. (*Bootstrap, Flask, MySQL*)

- **Talluri Technologies:** I redesigned a static [website](http://talluritechnologies.com/) belonging to a company I interned for. This was an exercise in front-end development and designing a good user interface. (*Bootstrap, jQuery*)

- **Chess Player API:** I used the "Scrapy" Python library to scrape [chess.com](https://www.chess.com/players) for a list of the world's best chess players and their relevant statistics. I stored the data in MongoDB, and created a Flask API which can both read and write to the database. (*Scrapy, Flask, MongoDB*)
